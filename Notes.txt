Design Principles:

1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

2. Open-Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

# Observer Pattern:
The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one objects changes state, 
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

# Decorator Pattern:
The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible
alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
